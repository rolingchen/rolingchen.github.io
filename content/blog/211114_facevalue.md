從哪看到：馬男波傑克 (BoJack Horseman) S2 E02

字面上很寫實，**take something/someone at face value**, 意指只憑表象毫無懷疑地信以為真，通訊太方便，這個時代要散播任何有心或無意的訊息都很快且具殺傷力，養成對任何傳遞到自己眼前的資訊都要有求證的習慣，不然就讓所有的訊息全部止於自己這端，不要再轉傳出去。

反義就是我不相信，看美劇常常會聽到 [**I don’t buy it (我不相信)**]簡單又好用。

分享兩段有用到take … at face value的youtube影片，youglish真是方便練聽力的網站

This is power in the information age.<br>
And this information is all that much more seductive,<br>
all that much easier to **take at face value** and pass on,
when it’s authentic.<br>
Who’s not interested in the truth that’s presented in phone calls and emails<br>
that were never intended for public consumption?<br>
But how meaningful is that truth<br>
if you don’t know why it’s being revealed to you?<br>
We must recognize that this place where we’re increasingly living,<br>
which we’ve quaintly termed “cyberspace,”<br>
isn’t defined by ones and zeroes,<br>
but by information and the people behind it.

The Open Mind: Susie Says – Susie Essman

(at 12:00)
{{< notice "note" >}}
about comedy and about the tradition in Jewish
life of questioning,<br>
of not just **taking things at face value** …<br>
of questioning and does this mean this,<br>
does this mean that?<br>
You know and really taking things apart
and looking at them through a different lens.<br>
You know, and having an open mind …<br>
so I think that that’s, that’s part of a Jewish
tradition also.<br>
And that’s what comics do, we look at things
in a different way, in a twisted way and we ask
a lot of questions.<br>
